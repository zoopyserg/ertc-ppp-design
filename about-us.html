                        <h4 class="question">The Story<br></h4>
                        <div class="answer">
                            <p><strong>JWC Employee Retention Tax Credit Advisory CPA</strong>&nbsp;was founded in March 2021 after passage of the&nbsp;<strong><em>Consolidated Appropriations Act</em></strong>&nbsp;signed into law December 27, 2020.<br></p>
                            <p>This law changed eligibility provisions in the&nbsp;<strong><em>CARES Act</em></strong>&nbsp;so that employers who previously received loans from the&nbsp;<strong><em>Payroll Protection Program</em></strong>&nbsp;(PPP), could now also claim employer tax credits retroactively for qualifing quarters of 2020 (in addition to many more advantageous modifications).<br></p>
                            <p>Our founder, Jace W Campbell, CPA (licensed in Texas since 2010), began his career as an auditor at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and Grant Thornton LLP. His clients included a diverse range of industries, including Dell Corporation, RadioShack, and DR Horton Homebuilders among others.<br></p>
                            <p>After eight years in public accounting, Mr. Campbell founded two other start-ups &nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="https://focusandscale.com/" target="_blank">Focus &amp; Scale</a>, a marketing consultancy, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://clearsmilenetwork.com/" target="_blank">ClearSmile Network</a>, an dental practice development firm. While overseeing these startups in early 2021, he began conversations with current clients about the new stimulus legislation.<br></p>
                            <p>At that point, Mr. Campbell's clients were primarily in the dental industry, and although they had a difficult 2020 and had all received&nbsp;<strong>Economic Injury Disaster Loans</strong>&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;<strong>PPP Loans</strong>, not one of them had received sound advice on the expansion of the&nbsp;<strong>Employee Retention Tax Credits</strong>.<br></p>
                            <p>When the&nbsp;<strong><em>American Rescue Plan Act of 2021</em></strong>&nbsp;was passed in March 2021, Mr. Campbell saw an even greater opportunity for his existing clients to claim the Employee Retention Tax Credits throughout 2021.<br></p>
                            <p>Yet, there was still no confident advice being offered by payroll services, SBA-approved lenders, income tax CPA's or bookkeepers due to the complexity of the law and none of these external advisors having the full picture to advise clients and ensure compliance.<br></p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4 class="text-nowrap question">The Problem:<br></h4>
                        <div class="answer">
                            <p><strong>Employee Retention Tax Credits</strong>&nbsp;are claimed through an employer's quartery tax filings and are audited by the IRS.<br></p>
                            <p>Whereas the&nbsp;<strong>Payroll Protection Program</strong>&nbsp;is administered by the&nbsp;<em>Small Business Administration</em>&nbsp;through thousands of SBA-approved lenders who process applications and ensure program compliance.<br></p>
                            <p>Properly determining ERTC eligibility, maximizing tax claims through coordination with PPP allocations, and contemporanously developing the documentation to support an IRS audit (the same as you would keep a receipt for a business purchase) - no current advisor is fully equipped to execute all of this . . . and none will risk the liability of being wrong.<br></p>
                            <p>Big businesses that&nbsp;<em>could</em>&nbsp;have the resources to execute, likely don't qualify for ERTC based on headcount limits.<br></p>
                            <p>And small businesses who&nbsp;<em>should</em>&nbsp;qualify based on headcount and revenue, likely don't have the internal expertise.<br></p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                        <h4 class="question">The Solution:<br></h4>
                        <div class="answer">
                            <p>What began as minor tax assistance for current dental consulting clients has since expanded to fill a gap in the market for small businesses across the country.<br></p>
                            <p>After seeing the volume of payroll data and complexity of assigning tax credits at the per-employee level, it was evident that most businesses couldn't claim these credits without bringing a CPA on staff focused soley on this.<br></p>
                            <p>And once we saw our first refund claim for $1,519,662 . . . that's when we knew our mission was larger than just our current clients . . . because every small business deserves to&nbsp;<strong>claim these refunds that are legally theirs</strong>.<br></p>
                            <p>That is when we invested in the&nbsp;<em>Client Dashboard</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Payroll Register Scripting Tools</em>&nbsp;to not just advise clients that they should look into ERTC, but to actually offer a Done-For-You ERTC refund claim process that we can confidently call&nbsp;<strong>The 15 Minute Refund™</strong>.<br></p>
